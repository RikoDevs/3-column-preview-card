Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

Hello,

here is my solution for "3 Column Preview Card Component" challenge from Frontend Mentor. While doing this challenge, i'm so excited and proceed to do all the steps by myself. Turns out, i'm able to do it without any help from the internet.

This time, i made 2 versions of the display, which are mobile (375px width) and desktop (1440px width), i hope you can give me any feedbacks so that i can observe what i did wrong from this code (see the code in index.html file).

Thankyou,
Riko
